# UX
This project is the assessment of the Html/Css modules for the Full Stack Software Development degree at Code Institute.
This is my first project. It is an idea that I have of setting up a web design company call: Web Design Alonso. 
Web design Alonso has a number of services such as: Web development, Web Ideas, Grapich Design and Digital Marketing.
It's a first project for my future stat-up based in Ireland and Spain. In this stage I only talk about web design in the second project I will introduce a brief introduction about another part of the company (Big data & Machine Learning).
