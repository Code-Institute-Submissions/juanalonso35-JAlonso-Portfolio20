# UX
This project is the assessment of the Html/Css modules for the Full Stack Software Development degree at Code Institute.
This is my first project. It is an idea that I have of setting up a web design company call: Web Design Alonso. 
Web design Alonso has a number of services such as: Web development, Web Ideas, Grapich Design and Digital Marketing.
It's a first project for my future stat-up based in Ireland and Spain. In this stage I only talk about web design in the second project I will introduce a brief introduction about another part of the company (Big data & Machine Learning).

# User Stories
"As a user, I want:"
To view the site on my preferred device (mobile, tablet, desktop).
To see what is the main activity of the bussiness web design Alonso, you can see in the section about us.
To view what are the main services of the company, you can get an idea in which services we are specialized.
To ask for information about projects in the section (contact me).

# Design

This site was built using Bootstrap, as well as refactored designs I used in my previous milestones.

# Framework

Bootstrap 4.3.1
I chose Bootstrap for its ease of use, its minimal use of classes compared to other front-end libraries, and its ability to be easily customized.

jQuery 3.3.1
I am using the version of jQuery recommended with Bootstrap for features like the navbar.

# Color Scheme
My goal was to use different tones of one color as the primary colors so that the overall design is cohesive. I used different colours to do the interface more dynamic for the future clients:
color:  #FFFAF0; Body color
background: #faad3b; color: #ffffff; Background color
Message box: color: #DAA520; background: #5c5cd6;
Contact form: #DAA520;
Footer: copyrights background-color: #1f1f1f;

# Icons
I used Flaticon to get the gorilla icon. The image is in the folder logo as a (logo.npg) it is a free resource from Internet.

# Typography
I specified one font from Google Fonts in my CSS variables. Ubuntu is the main font, I chose only one so that the website content would be easily readable.

# Features Left to implement
Due to time constraints, there are some additional features I wasn't able to implement.

Examples of project:
In the section services would be great to implement some examples of our jobs, it would be much better for the users in order
to have an idea about what is our job.

Customer reviews:
Reviews and opinions of people who contract our sevice before, it's help to new customer to believe in our company.

Big Data:
The idea of this start-up is implement a section related with Big data and Machine learning.

# Technologies Used

    * [JQuery](https://jquery.com) The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
    * HTML and CSS
    * Git Used for version control of project code.
    * GitHub - Used to remotely store project code.

# Testing
I manually tested the website at the meantime I was working on it.
Whenever the app crashed, debugger displayed an error message that made it clear what was causing the error. 
I was able to resolve issues by going back to the routes and templates and examining the relevant code.

# Acknowledgements

- I received inspiration for this project from other projects which I did during the course, portfolios and researches of companies help me to develop my ideas. I have an idea before started the course to create my own company (start-up tech company), this project is like a introduction of what I will do in the future when I finish my idea. Another idea for future projects is implement a section with Big data and machine learning.
